# d912pxy - "DirectX9 to DirectX12 API proxy for Guild Wars 2"

d912pxy is a way to make games that use DirectX 9 use DirectX 12 instead, without changing any game code.

This is specifically designed for Guild Wars 2.
You can try to use it with other games; it might work.

Expect some minor crashes / visual bugs.

# Showcase

Profiling shows that the API overhead for d912pxy is up to 86% (r255,custom config) less than that of plain DirectX9.
Real performance differs based on the scene and the hardware.

Benchmarking results on i7-7700/GTX960:

## CPU-bound scenario

## GPU-bound scenario
(1h fractal runs)

```
@all max, 1080p, v0.9.6.2a

16.4% to 2.5% less frame time

calculated based on API profiling & metrics data

This is affected by performance recording, and should be better in normal situations
